## Speaker Profile
Focused on improving internal operations at AKF, Shannon is adept at assembling teams with a diverse range of knowledge and experience to tackle the most complex challenges firms face. Shannon systematically analyzes, reviews, and optimizes operational flow across many aspects of the firm, including but not limited to, information management, training, and overall project execution. She is the software administrator for Deltek, Synthesis, and Newforma, as well as the manager of the PM Academy, Emerging Leaders Academy, and Support Services Academy in AKF’s internal training program – AKF Institute.  In her spare time Shannon also helps to relocate AKF offices when their leases expire.

## Talk Abstract
AKF had a problem — the proliferation of unreviewed standards were leading to employee frustration. Employees could not find the right resource at the right time and distrusted the technical content in their official, centralized, knowledge base. In the winter of 2017 they decided to do something about it. In her KA Connect 2019 talk, Shannon Kaplan will share the ins and outs of the content maintenance program that she designed and implemented to ensure that all employees would be able to find and use the firm’s latest and greatest technical content. 

## 
First project was managing Synthesis/Intranet implementation
Got a big group together
Reucrring theme: Don't want new system to be like old Intranet: where information goes to die.

Better organised content. Only had 2 people could update content. Wanted more maintainability

Wanted to keep content organised by group. Hard for content maintainers to remember where content stored.

Purged alot of content for launch. Less is more. Only relevant content 
Always pruning, taking things out


### Community Manager Meetings
6 communities. Meet twice a year with community managers. Maintenance started straight away

Meetings are informal. Tell managers they don't need to prepare anything. Avoiding getting blown off.

Start each meeting looking at analytics and then open community

Ask the questions:
- How is it going? 
- How is it working?
- How is the navigation?

Click into each piece of content. Is it fresh or not?
Identify each item that needs to be changed and the owner.

### Technical Community
Usage wasn't as high, not many people going to community

Discussed what people weren't finding. Led to thinking about how other people con contribute

Technical Director made appeal on Intranet fo contributors

#### Curation
Monitor posts. Delete incorrect comments and post correct answer

### Onboarding CMs
Provide access
Train on how to upload/update content

Invited to content review meeting. Went through the why?


### Impact of Technical community on emp experience
