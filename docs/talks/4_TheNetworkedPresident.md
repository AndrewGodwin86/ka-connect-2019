# The Networked President: Using Social Media to Improve Recruiting and Retention
Speaker: Mitch Fortner, President - KSA

## Speaker Profile
Mitch Fortner graduated from Texas A&M University with a degree in civil engineering in 1984 and has worked for KSA for over 31 years. Three years ago he was elected president of the firm, and since that time, he has been on a journey to “build people who build the future.” He is passionate about working cooperatively with other leaders in his firm to adapt KSA to meet the challenges of today and the future, including recruiting and retaining employees in our current AE marketplace with unprecedented levels of low unemployment. Networking, employment engagement, firm culture and values, and strategic planning have been major components of that journey.

## Talk Abstract
In the spring of 2018, Mitch Fortner walked out of a meeting about the challenges KSA was facing recruiting and retaining staff and asked himself the following question — “What can I, as the president of the firm, personally do about this?” Mitch’s answer was to launch an internal and external social media campaign which talked openly about his personal career journey, explored the current challenges and opportunities facing KSA and the industry at large, and sparked conversation about the future of the profession. In this talk, Mitch will share why he does it, how he does it, and the impact of his efforts to date.
