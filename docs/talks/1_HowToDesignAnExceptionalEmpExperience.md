Jim Harter, Ph.D., is Chief Scientist of Workplace Management and Well-Being for Gallup's workplace management practice.

Updated periodically, this study currently covers 82,000 business units and includes 1.8 million employees in 230 organizations, across 49 industries, and in 73 countries. His work has appeared in many publications, including Harvard Business Review, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, Fast Company, TIME Magazine, and in academic articles and book chapters. 

Since joining Gallup in 1985, Dr. Harter has authored or coauthored more than 1,000 research studies for organizations on employee engagement and talent and on topics in applied psychology and well-being.
