## TL;DR
...

## Talk Abstract
When Donovan Helminiak started as KTGY’s first Knowledge Manager four years ago, most people in the firm didn’t know what Knowledge Management was and why Donovan was there. Fast forward to 2019, and you’ll learn that Donovan’s team has more projects in their backlog than they can handle, ranging from Internal Communications to Business Intelligence. How did this happen? Donovan learned how to create trust by delivering business value for KTGY, removing friction from employees’ daily lives, and switching from teaching people about KM to teaching them how to take advantage of KTGY’s network of resources. 

## Speaker Profile
As Knowledge Manager, Donovan is the champion and facilitator for identifying, capturing, and using knowledge to enable the people at KTGY to make better decisions faster. With a background in learning and development, business/systems analysis, and internal communications—experience that pulls from multiple industries like automotive, financial, and now AEC—Donovan has a unique perspective on how to tackle business problems. On a given day, you can find him conducting a communication strategy session, moving onto a project performance data exploration, and then literally running for the hills of Southern California.
