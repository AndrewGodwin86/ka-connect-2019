## Speaker Profile
Krista is a Principal at Affiliated Engineers, Inc. (AEI) and a member of AEI’s national executive team.  Based in San Francisco, she leads both the SF office operations as well as AEI’s firmwide Company Wide Teams, discipline-specific communities of practice, focused on quality, training, and continuous improvement.  As an electrical engineer with technically complex project experience for owners such as Stanford University, LBNL, and an array of Northern California prominent life sciences companies and developers, she leads AEI’s quest for knowledge sharing and a desire to leverage project experience between AEI’s most senior and most recently hired engineers.

## Talk Abstract
AEI has re-energized their approach to connecting technical staff across offices and disciplines with a program called Company Wide Teams (CWTs). CWTs share best practices, exchange lessons learned, and manage design tools to help improve quality, provide training, and drive continuous improvement efforts across the firm. In her KA Connect 2019 talk, Krista Murphy will share how AEI’s CWTs help the firm to engage all engineers at each stage of their professional career as well as the behind-the-scenes work needed to make the program succeed.
